# Pokemon Memory Card Game

A dynamic memory card game built as part of **The Odin Project** curriculum.  
The goal is simple: click each card **only once**. Clicking the same card twice resets your score.

This project focuses on **state management**, **component re-renders**, and **React fundamentals**.

## 🧠 What I Learned

This project helped reinforce several core React concepts:

- Managing game state with `useState`
- Using `useEffect` for side effects
- Shuffling data without mutating state
- Passing props and callbacks between components

- Structuring a React app cleanly
